### **Chapter I. Practical Utility**

ARC is a portable device built for developers, researchers, and engineers who need debugging, communication, and RF/NFC analysis tools in the field. It combines a Linux-based mini-computer (Orange Pi Zero 2 W) with a custom motherboard that includes a keyboard, a 3.5" SPI screen, I²S audio output, a battery, and power circuits.

**Problem Solved**: It's an autonomous, compact, and multifunctional device for field testing and communication operations (e.g., pentesting, RF sniffing, NFC reading/emulation).

**Efficiency Compared to Alternatives**: Unlike a laptop with external adapters, ARC is much more portable, has a tactile interface and its own keyboard, and is designed for quick work or debugging sessions in the field.

#### **Section III.1. Complexity**

- Semi-autonomous device, but it can execute tasks completely independently (e.g., WiFi scanning, RF Sniffing, etc.) through its graphical interface.

---

### **Chapter IV. Software**

- The operating system is a custom distribution based on Armbian with Openbox + a minimal desktop environment built in Python (ARC Desktop Environment).
- The interface is created in Python using Pygame.
- Each application is modular and runs in isolation.
- Every UI element, integrated application, script path, and more can be modified by editing the *'arc.yaml'* file located in */.config*.
- The keyboard firmware is written in **CircuitPython** and transmits the button matrix codes to a Python script on the SBC to emulate key presses. To provide full functionality, the keyboard uses a layer system similar to smartphones. The keyboard layout can be modified from the Python script that interprets the key codes.
- Application Types:
    - Terminal
    - Calendar
    - WiFi tools
    - Bluetooth tools
    - IR tools
    - RF tools
    - NFC tools
    - Music player
    - Game launcher
    - Other Linux applications

#### WiFi Tools – Support for Wireless Network Analysis and Attacks

**WiFi Tools** is a graphical suite of tools for scanning, monitoring, and testing WiFi networks, designed for Linux systems with interfaces compatible with monitor mode. The interface is built in Python using Pygame, and the functionalities are built on top of classic utilities like `iwlist`, `airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng`, and `aircrack-ng`.

| ip | iproute2 | Standard utility for configuring network interfaces |

#### Bluetooth Tools – Utilities for Scanning, Connecting, and Testing Bluetooth Devices

**Bluetooth Tools** is a graphical interface that provides quick access to functions for scanning, connecting, managing, and testing Bluetooth devices, using `bluetoothctl` and `l2ping` in the background.

#### IR, NFC, RF Tools – Graphical Interfaces for Communication with External Modules

**IR, NFC, and RF Tools** are applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitate communication with specialized modules connected via UART, such as:

- **IR Modules** – for transmitting or recording infrared signals.
- **NFC Modules** – for reading and emulating NFC tags (with limited capabilities).
- **RF Modules** – for scanning, capturing, or transmitting radio signals in various frequencies.

#### Music Player – Play and Organize Local Audio Files

**Music Player** is an application that allows playing local audio files in .mp3 and .flac formats, offering a simple interface for navigation and playback control.

**Main Features:**

- **Sort by album or artist** – songs are automatically organized using metadata from the files.
- **Configure music folder** – the location of the audio files is specified in the *arc.yaml* file, located in the */.config* directory.
- **Display metadata** – title, duration, and album art are extracted from file metadata using the `mutagen` library.
- **Selection interface** – the user can browse through songs and select files for playback.
- **Playback menu** – allows control over playback with Play/Pause, Skip Forward, and Skip Backward functions, as well as viewing playback progress (current time).
- **Display album art** – the song's cover image is displayed on the playback screen if available in the metadata.

#### Game Launcher – Customizable Game Launcher

**Game Launcher** is an application that provides a simple graphical interface for launching locally installed games using user-defined Bash commands.

**Main Features:**

- **Quick game launching** – each game is associated with a Bash command that will be executed upon selection.
- **Flexible configuration** – games are defined in a `games.json` file, which contains the name and launch command for each game.
- **Custom file location** – the location of the `games.json` file can be specified in the *arc.yaml* file, located in the system's `.config` directory.
- **Simple interface** – the user can browse and select the desired game from an interactive list.

The application allows for easy integration of any game or emulator installed on the system.

#### ARC Connect

*This is not the final version; the images are to show the design concept.*

**[ARC]** can be connected to a web interface (FastAPI server) where we can:
- Monitor resource usage, uptime, IP address, and available storage space.
- Use a web-based SSH terminal (we can run commands directly from a browser).
- Transfer files to the `/uploads` folder.

To connect to this server, you must be connected with your laptop/phone to the same network as the **[ARC]** device and enter the IP, username, and password on the page [https://arc.istratiestefan.com/arc-connect](https://arc.istratiestefan.com/arc-connect).

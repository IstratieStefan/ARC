# ARC Launcher

\`launcher.py\` is the main entry point for the ARC desktop environment. It provides the application launcher, home screen, and system integration for ARC devices.

---

## Features

- Launches and manages ARC apps in a fullscreen interface
- Loads configuration from a YAML or Python config file
- Displays a grid of app icons, top bar with system status, and quick access to built-in utilities
- Handles user input from keyboard, touchscreen, and custom hardware
- Supports theming, custom icons, and multiple built-in apps

---

## Usage

Run the launcher directly:

\`\`\`bash
python3 launcher.py
\`\`\`

Or, add it to your startup applications for auto-launch at boot.

## Customization

Apps and icons are configured in the YAML file in your .config directory.

Appearance, colors, and layout are all customizable via the config.

Add or remove apps by editing the builtin_apps section of the config.

## Development

Written in Python using Pygame for rendering and input.

Requires the config.py module and access to resource folders (icons, fonts, etc.).

Screen resolution is **480x320** pixels by default.

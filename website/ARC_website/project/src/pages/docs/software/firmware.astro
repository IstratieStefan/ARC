## Firmware

ARC’s firmware is divided into two core components, each responsible for critical hardware features:

### 1. Keyboard Firmware

- **Platform:** Runs on the Waveshare RP2040 Pico Mini microcontroller
- **Customization:**  
  - The keyboard firmware is written in CircuitPython
  - Users can easily modify key mappings, layers, macros, and special functions by editing the main script (\`code.py\`) directly on the device (shows up as a USB drive when connected to a PC)

> For a full list, see the [CircuitPython HID Keycode Documentation](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/hid/en/latest/api.html#keycode).

### 2. Display Driver

- **Driver:** \`fbcp-ili9341\` (Framebuffer Copy for ILI9341 displays)
- **Role:**  
  - Bridges the Raspberry Pi’s main framebuffer to the 3.5" SPI TFT display used by ARC
  - Ensures smooth graphics, touch input support, and compatibility with the custom launcher
- **Configuration:**  
  - Driver is managed as a systemd service, auto-starting on boot
  - Supports screen rotation, custom resolutions, and performance tweaks

> Together, these firmware components enable a fully custom, reprogrammable user interface and seamless hardware integration for ARC.

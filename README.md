ARC - All in one Remote Console


**ARC (All-in-one Remote Console)** is a compact, Linux-powered handheld device designed for hackers, developers, and field engineers. It combines a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a custom-designed PCB that integrates GSM (SIM800L), LoRa (SX1276), Wi-Fi tools, infrared (IR), NFC (PN532), and a full QWERTY keyboard controlled by a Waveshare RP2040 Pico Mini. ARC features a 3.5" color display, I2S Hi-Fi audio with both speaker and 3.5mm jack (auto-switched via headphone detection), a vibration motor for haptic feedback, an RGB notification LED, and a fuel gauge (MAX17048) for precise battery monitoring. 
All power is managed through a USB-C charge circuit (TP4056 with protection) and a soft power sleep system that mimics smartphone behavior. The device also exposes GPIO headers for debugging or sensor expansion and supports UART, SPI, and I2C. ARC includes tools for RF testing, phone control, LoRa messaging, NFC reading/writing, and IR signal learning. Its custom-built ARC Desktop Environment includes a modular app launcher with touch and keyboard support, a system bar with indicators, and apps like terminal, SMS/call manager, LoRa chat, NFC tools, and hardware I/O control. Designed for both offline operation and full extensibility, ARC is a true all-in-one remote console â€” portable, hackable, and ready for the field.

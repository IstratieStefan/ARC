# ARC Modules and Add-ons

## Modular Communication Backpacks

ARC supports a range of modular communication add-ons—known as "backpacks"—which connect directly to the GPIO header on the back of the device. These modules enable powerful wireless and proximity features while maintaining a portable, upgradeable design.

### Supported Modules

- **LoRa (SX1276):**  
  Enables long-range, low-power communication for IoT and custom radio networks. Perfect for off-grid messaging, telemetry, and mesh networking experiments.

- **RF (CC1101, NRF24):**  
  Allows versatile sub-GHz (315/433/868/915 MHz) and 2.4 GHz wireless operations for device control, signal analysis, and penetration testing.

- **NFC (PN532):**  
  Offers support for NFC reading/writing, MIFARE Classic/Ultralight, and peer-to-peer applications. Ideal for access control projects and RFID research.

- **IR (Infrared):**  
  For learning, sending, and emulating IR remote control signals—great for smart home and AV automation.

### Expansion Port Details

- **Connector:** Standard 2.54mm GPIO header on ARC's back side.
- **Interfaces:**  
  - **UART**
  - **I2C**
  - **SPI**
- **Power:** 5V and GND pins are available for module power.
- **Mounting:**  
  Modules are designed to stack securely like a backpack, with custom or off-the-shelf PCBs.

### Key Features

- **Hot-swappable:** Attach or detach modules without opening the main enclosure.
- **Auto-detection:** ARC’s software can detect and initialize supported modules at boot or on demand.
- **Open architecture:** Supports both official and DIY add-ons, with full access to communication buses and power rails.

> **Tip:** Example wiring diagrams and supported backpack pinouts are available in the [Schematics](#) section.

# ARC ‚Äì All-in-one Remote Console

## üöÄ What is ARC?

**ARC (All-in-one Remote Console)** is a portable, open-source, modular toolkit for makers, hackers, engineers, and anyone passionate about wireless technologies.  
Built around a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, ARC brings together NFC, RF, LoRa, GSM, and a full-featured Linux terminal in a single handheld device, complete with a touchscreen, physical keyboard, and battery power.

> **Think of ARC as the Swiss Army knife for wireless tech:** scan NFC tags, analyze RF signals, communicate over LoRa or GSM, and launch custom apps, all from your pocket.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Multi-protocol support:**  
  Interact with and test a huge range of wireless protocols:  
  - **NFC** (read/write/emulate cards)  
  - **RF** (analyze and transmit common signals)  
  - **LoRa** (long-range IoT comms)  
  - **GSM** (SMS, calls, and data via SIM800L)

- **Touchscreen GUI + Full QWERTY Keyboard:**  
  Easy-to-use interface designed for both touchscreen and physical input.

- **Modular software architecture:**  
  Each function (NFC, RF, LoRa, etc.) is its own app, launchable from a custom Python launcher.

- **Portable and battery-powered:**  
  Designed for fieldwork and everyday portability‚Äîno need for a laptop or separate adapters.

- **Fully open-source:**  
  Hardware designs, schematics, and all source code are open and customizable.

## üö® IMPORTANT: Fix Import Errors

If you're seeing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config'` on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
cd /home/admin/ARC
git pull
```

**All import statements have been fixed!** See [`FIX_NOW.md`](FIX_NOW.md) for details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration for Your Installation

The default configuration is set for `/home/admin/ARC` on Raspberry Pi.

If you've installed ARC in a different location, update the app paths:

```bash
cd /home/admin/ARC  # or your installation path
./generate_config.sh
```

This ensures all apps launch correctly from anywhere, using the virtual environment.

### **Chapter I. Practical Utility**

ARC is a portable device built for developers, researchers, and engineers who need debugging, communication, and RF/NFC analysis tools in the field. It combines a Linux-based mini-computer (Orange Pi Zero 2 W) with a custom motherboard that includes a keyboard, a 3.5" SPI screen, I¬≤S audio output, a battery, and power circuits.

**Problem Solved**: It's an autonomous, compact, and multifunctional device for field testing and communication operations (e.g., pentesting, RF sniffing, NFC reading/emulation).

**Efficiency Compared to Alternatives**: Unlike a laptop with external adapters, ARC is much more portable, has a tactile interface and its own keyboard, and is designed for quick work or debugging sessions in the field.

### **Chapter IV. Software**

- The operating system is a custom distribution based on Armbian with Openbox + a minimal desktop environment built in Python (ARC Desktop Environment).
- The interface is created in Python using Pygame.
- Each application is modular and runs in isolation.
- Every UI element, integrated application, script path, and more can be modified by editing the *'arc.yaml'* file located in */.config*.
- The keyboard firmware is written in **CircuitPython** and transmits the button matrix codes to a Python script on the SBC to emulate key presses. To provide full functionality, the keyboard uses a layer system similar to smartphones. The keyboard layout can be modified from the Python script that interprets the key codes.

- **Selection interface** ‚Äì the user can browse through songs and select files for playback.
- **Playback menu** ‚Äì allows control over playback with Play/Pause, Skip Forward, and Skip Backward functions, as well as viewing playback progress (current time).
- **Display album art** ‚Äì the song's cover image is displayed on the playback screen if available in the metadata.

#### Game Launcher ‚Äì Customizable Game Launcher

**Game Launcher** is an application that provides a simple graphical interface for launching locally installed games using user-defined Bash commands.

**Main Features:**

- **Quick game launching** ‚Äì each game is associated with a Bash command that will be executed upon selection.
- **Flexible configuration** ‚Äì games are defined in a `games.json` file, which contains the name and launch command for each game.
- **Custom file location** ‚Äì the location of the `games.json` file can be specified in the *arc.yaml* file, located in the system's `.config` directory.
- **Simple interface** ‚Äì the user can browse and select the desired game from an interactive list.

The application allows for easy integration of any game or emulator installed on the system.

#### ARC Connect

*This is not the final version; the images are to show the design concept.*

**[ARC]** can be connected to a web interface (FastAPI server) where we can:
- Monitor resource usage, uptime, IP address, and available storage space.
- Use a web-based SSH terminal (we can run commands directly from a browser).
- Transfer files to the `/uploads` folder.

To connect to this server, you must be connected with your laptop/phone to the same network as the **[ARC]** device and enter the IP, username, and password on the page [https://arc.istratiestefan.com/arc-connect](https://arc.istratiestefan.com/arc-connect).
